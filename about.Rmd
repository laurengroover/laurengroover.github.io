Hi! My name is Lauren Groover. I am a senior honors student at Kennesaw State University majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Applied Statistics and Data Analysis. I am currently on track to graduate with honors in December 2019.

During my time at Kennesaw State University, I participated in R Day 2018 and Analytics Day 2019, with plans to participate in R Day 2019. I was awarded 1st place at R Day 2018 for my project, "Increasing the Top Line by Thousands." In this project, I utilized proactive outreach and marketing strategies to increase revenue by $11,496 annually at my current place of employment, Life Time. You can view my full project on my LinkedIn (make LinkedIn a hyperlink to actual page).

Currently, I am an Aquatics Assistant Manager at Life Time. As the assistant manager, I oversee 40+ team members, manage financials, and deliver exceptional customer service. During my time in this position, I assisted in the rebuild of the Life Time Aquatics Swim Program at the club. As a revenue-driven department, we prioritize customer experience. With 5+ years of professional customer service experience, I continue to provide outstanding-quality service and fill the role of the go-to person to handle a variety of member situations. Since the initial rebuild, my team has had great success as we have exceeded in all of our financial goals and we have one of the most successful Aquatics departments in the Southeastern Region!

I have a wide variety of professional skills, including intermediate experience in Mark-Up languages HTML and CSS, programming languages Java and C#, and working with the hosting service, GitHub. As well as advanced experience in Microsoft Office, and programming languages R, Python, and SAS. Furthermore, my extensive customer service experience allows me to continue on to any career with three key qualities - patience, communication, and the ability to think on my feet. 

My unique experiences in my rigorous education, workplace successes, and professional skills allow me to pursue success in any form that it may take.
