Hi! My name is Lauren Groover. I am a senior honors student at Kennesaw State University majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Applied Statistics and Data Analysis. I am passionate about mathematics, statistics, and the planet.

During my time at Kennesaw State University, I participated in R Day 2018 and Analytics Day 2019, with plans to participate in R Day 2019. I was awarded 1st place at R Day 2018 for my project, "Increasing the Top Line by Thousands."
