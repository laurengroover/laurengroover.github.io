Hi! My name is Lauren. I am a senior honors student at Kennesaw State University majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Applied Statistics and Data Analysis. I am passionate about mathematics, statistics, and the planet. During my time at Kennesaw State University I participated in R Day 2018, Analytics Day 2019, and R Day 2019. My presentation was awarded 1st place at R Day 2018, and I learned so much participating in the three conferences. I hope to one day use statistics to make a difference in at least one person's (or animal's) world.

Soon, my husband and I are packing up a jeep with all our belongings and our two cats and driving across country to Montana. We are outdoor-loving, tree-hugging, adventurous people. I care immensely for our blue planet and couldn't imagine a better place to experience its natural beauty. 

I hope my website provided some useful information for readers to take better care of our only home!
