-	Many power plants need to shut down and new power plants should not be built. About 33% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions in 2018 were caused by the U.S. electric power sector!
-	Plant a lot of trees. A study by researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, one of the world's leading universities in science and technology, stated that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today. Increasing the Earth’s forests by an area the size of the United States would cut atmospheric carbon dioxide 25 percent!
-	Deploy technologies that capture carbon on a massive scale, such as the carbon capture & storage association. 
-	Replace fossil fuels with renewable and cleaner sources of energy, such as wind and sun.
